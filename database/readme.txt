dbRabbitMQListener is able to connect to webPage/index.php

Problems:
	need to make register work
	
	There are problems with the arrays when logging in
	input array is fine, but when the function uses the array the return is empty
	The listener also runs twice for some reason
	
To Run:
	go to localhost/login.php

	run dbRabbitMQListener.php

	input data into the html form

	look at output in terminal for Lisener
